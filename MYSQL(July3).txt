Insert data into the table:

 

Insert at least five sales transactions into the "sales" table, each with different product names, quantities, unit prices, customer names, and sale dates.
Retrieve data from the table:

 

Write SQL queries to retrieve the following information:
Retrieve all sales transactions made by a specific customer (e.g., customer_name = 'John Smith')
Retrieve sales transactions made by a specific customer (e.g., customer_name = 'John Smith') and a specific product (e.g., product_name = 'Widget'):
Retrieve sales transactions made by either a specific customer (e.g., customer_name = 'John Smith') or a specific product (e.g., product_name = 'Widget')
Retrieve sales transactions with a quantity greater than 10 and a total price less than 100:
Retrieve sales transactions made on a specific date (e.g., sale_date = '2023-06-30') and with a total price greater than or equal to 500:
